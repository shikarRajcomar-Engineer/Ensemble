I have recently abandon my carrer as an Engineer for the last 7 years to embark on a journey towards Data Science
The 4th industrial revolution brings about an evolution on the ways the the world works but in order to full relize this revolution research,skills,and advancements in technology is needed.

To play my part in this revolution I am trying to develop a method to help improve image classifiers and the current limiting factos of not having enough data to build models.
